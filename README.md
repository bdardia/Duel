# Duel
Two pretty good bots fighting each other in a duel to the death

Player_3 will always win once it takes the lead. When it has more health than its opponent (and they're loaded) it will block every turn.

Player_12 will shoot based on the health difference between the two bots. If it's a close game, it wont risk as much by shooting less.
If it needs to stage a comeback or hold a lead, it will shoot more often. When losing, a modifier is added so it will shoot more.
